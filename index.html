      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
          Hi there! I'm Shehzad Khan, a passionate Fullstack Developer with a focus on the MERN stack
          (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I thrive on turning ideas into interactive and
          user-friendly web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
          My journey in the world of web development began with a fascination for creating dynamic and
          responsive websites. Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript,
          and I am proficient in building scalable and efficient applications using the MERN stack.
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest
          technologies and best practices in the field. I am always excited to take on new challenges
          and collaborate with like-minded individuals to bring innovative ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source
          projects, or enjoying a good cup of coffee while reading about the latest trends in tech.
      </p>
